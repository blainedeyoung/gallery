          I am bright, eager, and quick to learn.  For the last year or so I've been working with a military contractor on a massive multi-language application to facilitate communication and support soldiers' tactical awareness in the field.  I have a Master’s Degree in Applied Computing from Eastern Kentucky University.  
         </p>
         <p class="about-block">
          I’m proficient with C#, Java, and Javascript and have some familiarity with a handful of other programming languages including C++, Python, and PHP.  I'm familiar with working in a Linux environment and can write shell scripts.  I have advanced knowledge of front-end technologies: AngularJS, ReactJS, CSS, SASS, and Bootstrap.  I’m well-versed with cloud computing with AWS, Azure, and heroku.  I’ve used both relational and non-relational databases: SQL and MongoDB.  I’ve set up servers and RESTful APIs using Express and am familiar with consuming such APIs.
        </p>
        <p class="about-block">
          I have a strong background in science, math, statistics, and if we ever play Trivial Pursuit you’ll probably want me on your team.  Moreover, I have enough experience to be confident that anything I don’t know I’ll be able to learn quickly.  I am curious and constantly on the look-out for new and better ways to solve problems.  I believe in building software that not only works but does so efficiently and provides the end-user with all the functionality that he needs with a minimum of effort on his part.
        </p>
        <p class="about-block">
          I'd prefer to make next position 100% remote, so I can stay in my apartment until the lease expires in March.  But I am willing to relocate now for the right opportunity.

        <p class="about-block">
          I’m certain that with my skills and experience I can be a great benefit to you in your work.  I’m available to start immediately.  Please call or email to schedule an interview.

               Clicking on any of the images listed in any of the projects menus will redirect you to that page (except the one representing this page.)  I invite you to visit any of the websites presented here (including this one) on mobile devices or indeed monitors of any size.  In fact, I hope you will.  Coding the responsive behaviors was the hardest part of making the sites.  It would be a shame if no one appreciated them.

                   The domain "blainedeyoung.com" is registered with Route 53 and is routed to an elastic IP attached to that EC2.
                   The domain also has an alias, so either "blainedeyoung.com" or "www.blainedeyoung.com" reaches the same site.
                   The site itself uses HTML, custom SCSS, and simple javascript.

               These sites are mock-ups, front-end stubs.  Links won't go anywhere.  Buttons and form elements may or may not do anything.
               I'm making them as an exercise in design and CSS.  They use themed Bootstrap 5.0.1.  Look for a grey aboutPanel at the bottom
               of each site for information about the content and functionality.

                   My idea for the first two sites is a store that sells a wide variety of cloths.
                   They've decided to divide their offerings into two groups, cloths that are worn because they look good
                   (Fashion over Function) and cloths that are worn because they're good for something (Function over Fashion).
                   This seems like a highly questionable marketing strategy to me, but hey, I just make the websites.

                   Continuing the theme of the clothing store, we have another website made with mostly the same technology and resources from the same open source sites.  It has a different layout,
                   color scheme, and some different components and so hopefully evokes a different mood.  The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/blainedeyoung/function-over-fashion" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

                These are MERN stack apps.  React front-ends, node/express controllers, and MongoDB models using mongoose.  Hosting them properly on this server would require setting up a load balancer which would cost money, so for the time being I have them deployed on heroku.  All their code is available on github.  Their databases are hosted by MongoDB Atlas.<br>  
                <br>
                These are old apps I made in Vschool (before I learned bootstrap and SASS).  They don't use Redux but use High Order Components as Context providers.  
                It's not very efficient.  I'm providing a lot of components with information they don't need.  Their functionality is fairly elementary on top of which they're ugly.<br>  
                <br>
                There are a thousand things I could do to make these apps better, but I'd rather make some new apps.  Of course that will take time.  I include them so you can see I know the basics of making MERN stack apps with CRUD functionality.  You can log into them with username blainedeyoung and password 424242 to see the demo I've set up or register or own user or both.
