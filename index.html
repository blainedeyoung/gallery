               Clicking on any of the images listed in any of the projects menus will redirect you to that page (except the one representing this page.)  I invite you to visit any of the websites presented here (including this one) on mobile devices or indeed monitors of any size.  In fact, I hope you will.  Coding the responsive behaviors was the hardest part of making the sites.  It would be a shame if no one appreciated them.

                 <p class="list-description">This website is hosted by the Apache webserver on my personal AWS EC2.
                   The domain "blainedeyoung.com" is registered with Route 53 and is routed to an elastic IP attached to that EC2.
                   The domain also has an alias, so either "blainedeyoung.com" or "www.blainedeyoung.com" reaches the same site.
                   The site itself uses HTML, custom SCSS, and simple javascript.
                   The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/blainedeyoung/gallery" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

               These sites are mock-ups, front-end stubs.  Links won't go anywhere.  Buttons and form elements may or may not do anything.
               I'm making them as an exercise in design and CSS.  They use themed Bootstrap 5.0.1.  Look for a grey aboutPanel at the bottom
               of each site for information about the content and functionality.

                   My idea for the first two sites is a store that sells a wide variety of cloths.
                   They've decided to divide their offerings into two groups, cloths that are worn because they look good
                   (Fashion over Function) and cloths that are worn because they're good for something (Function over Fashion).
                   This seems like a highly questionable marketing strategy to me, but hey, I just make the websites.

                   Continuing the theme of the clothing store, we have another website made with mostly the same technology and resources from the same open source sites.  It has a different layout,
                   color scheme, and some different components and so hopefully evokes a different mood.  The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/blainedeyoung/function-over-fashion" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

                    At Tomb Planers the motto is "It's not just a trip.  It's an adventure!"  It's a travel agency that offers package destination vacation deals.  This site features a javascript app a little more sophisticated than what I've demonstrated so far.
